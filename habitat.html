          These free-swimming marine creatures are found in warm and cold ocean waters, in deep waters and even along the coastline. Most are found in shallow waters, although some are discovered around 3800 metres deep in the ocean. Although located almost in every ocean, they are able to survive due to their physique, with a typically transparent saucer-shaped body, stinging tentacles trail along the edge, and they come in sizes of around 2-40 centimetres in diameter.
