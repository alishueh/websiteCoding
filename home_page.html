            <strong>[Please view on 110% zoom]</strong> Jellyfish are among the world’s most ancient creatures, arriving before the dinosaurs, drifting along the ocean currents for millions of years.  Despite their name, jellyfish are not actual fishes, but a planktonic marine member of the class Scyphozoa, which is a group of invertebrate animals composed of about 200 described species. 
            <p class="text">They come in colours of purple, pink and yellow, blue, and often are luminescent; some even have the ability to glow in the dark, shining alight for you to follow. Because they are not like normal animals, they have no ears, eyes or brain. Their main function is to eat. A jellyfish’s diet consists of zooplankton, fish, shrimp, crabs, tiny plants and even other smaller jellyfish. Overall, jellyfish are a fascinating species, being an ancient invertebrate.</p>

          <p class="slogan">What does the jellyfish symbolise?</p>
          <p class="text">Throughout a jellyfish's life, they get carried around by the water current, meaning that they live a life of complete trust and surrender. That is partly why jellyfish symbolism and meanings include energetic flow, beauty, being in flow, regeneration, immortality, and intuition. All these words have a tranquil feel to them, as that is what a jellyfish feels like, inside and out.

          Jellyfish have been found in many different oceans, in many different water types. There are numerous species of jellyfish that have grown and evolved. They do not have a brain, eyes or ears, and only act on instinct. They are from one of the oldest branches of the animal tree. They also play an important role in the marine ecosystem and are a key source of food for some fish and sea turtles. In general, jellyfish are and have played an important role in our ocean for food chains, and are lively and free beings, symbolising the feeling of a flow.
