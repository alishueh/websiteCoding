            <strong>[Please view on 110% zoom]</strong> Jellyfish are among the world’s most ancient creatures, arriving before the dinosaurs, drifting along the ocean currents for millions of years.  Despite their name, jellyfish are not actual fishes, but a planktonic marine member of the class Scyphozoa, which is a group of invertebrate animals composed of about 200 described species. These free-swimming marine creatures are found in warm and cold ocean waters, in deep waters and even along the coastline. Most are found in shallow waters, although some are discovered around 3800 metres deep in the ocean. Although located almost in every ocean, they are able to survive due to their physique, with a typically transparent saucer-shaped body, stinging tentacles trail along the edge, and they come in sizes of around 2-40 centimetres in diameter. They come in colours of purple, pink and yellow, some even have the ability to glow in the dark, shining alight for you to follow. Because they are not like normal animals, they have no ears, eyes or brain. Their main function is to eat. A jellyfish’s diet consists of zooplankton, small crustaceans, small fish and even other smaller jellyfish.
